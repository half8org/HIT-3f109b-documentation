# Chromium Browser Extension

## MultiversX DeFi Wallet

Popularly referred to as the "future of money," MultiversX currently has a robust web wallet extension known as the **MultiversX DeFi Wallet**. It is a powerful browser extension for the MultiversX Wallet that effectively automates and reduces the steps and time required for users to interact with MultiversX Decentralized apps.

The MultiversX DeFi Wallet can be installed on Firefox, Chrome, Brave, and other chromium-based browsers. This extension is free and secure, with compelling features that allow you to create a new wallet or import existing wallets, manage multiple wallets on the MultiversX mainnet, and store MultiversX tokens such as EGLD, ESDT, or NFTs on the MultiversX Network with easy accessibility.

Let's walk through the steps on how to install and set up the MultiversX DeFi Wallet extension:

### Prerequisites[​](https://docs.multiversx.com/wallet/wallet-extension/#prerequisites) <a href="#prerequisites" id="prerequisites"></a>

#### Create a new wallet[​](https://docs.multiversx.com/wallet/wallet-extension/#create-a-new-wallet) <a href="#create-a-new-wallet" id="create-a-new-wallet"></a>

**Step 1:** To get started, first install the [MultiversX DeFi wallet extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/multiversx-defi-wallet/dngmlblcodfobpdpecaadgfbcggfjfnm).

**Step 2:** Open up the extension and click on _‘’Create new wallet”_.

**Step 3:** Next, a secret phrase consisting of a set of 24 secret words will be displayed. Safely backup these secret words. We strongly recommend you write them down or copy and store them in a safe place like a password manager. These secret words are the key to your wallet account and cannot be recovered if lost.

![MultiversX-defi-example-secret-phrase](https://docs.multiversx.com/assets/images/mnemonic\_extension-5ba23354b10ffdbc3b9a6bdc72a01ad7.png)

**Step 4:** Before proceeding to the next step, confirm that you have safely stored your secret phrase.

**Step 5:** For further verification, you will be prompted to input some of the secret words.

**Step 6:** Create a password that will be used to access the wallets stored in the MultiversX DeFi wallet extension. Ensure you keep this password safe as it will be needed to access your wallets regularly. Please note that this password cannot be recovered if lost.

![MultiversX-defi-example-password](https://docs.multiversx.com/assets/images/extension\_password-c69af9f9920b0b7503c0a6ef5d931960.png)

#### Import existing wallet[​](https://docs.multiversx.com/wallet/wallet-extension/#import-existing-wallet) <a href="#import-existing-wallet" id="import-existing-wallet"></a>

Do you already have a wallet?

Then there is no need to create a new one. The MultiversX Wallet Extension provides an option to import your existing wallet. However, to import an existing wallet you must have access to its **secret (recovery) phrase**.

The MultiversX wallet has a set of 24-words, which serve as your wallet’s secret phrase. Using a secret phrase to import an existing wallet does not affect your wallet in any way.

**To get started:**

**Step 1:** With the [MultiversX DeFi wallet extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/multiversx-defi-wallet/dngmlblcodfobpdpecaadgfbcggfjfnm) installed. Click on ‘’Import existing wallet”.

![MultiversX-defi-example-welcome-page](https://docs.multiversx.com/assets/images/extension-f84ce9d47989aa1a91e436942e1dc7d6.png)

**Step 2:** Next, enter your 24-word secret phrase. You can either enter these words one at a time or you can simply paste in the words using the "_paste_" icon.
