# Introduction to $HIT Token

***

## Intro

The $HIT Token emerges as a groundbreaking addition to the MultiversX ecosystem, introducing a revolutionary DeRug Protocol (DRGP). This unique protocol is designed to address and mitigate the prevalence of rug-pulled NFTs within the MultiversX blockchain, offering a novel solution to an age-old problem. By incentivizing the community to identify and burn these rugged NFTs, participants are rewarded with $HIT tokens. This not only cleanses the ecosystem of undesirable assets but also significantly increases transaction volume, contributing to the growth and vibrancy of the MultiversX blockchain.

## **Background Information on the MultiversX Blockchain and $HIT's Integration**

Introducing $HIT – the MeMe coin that's been missing from your portfolio. Originating from the creative mind of @fkingerd, despite a somewhat delayed start due to programming enhancements, $HIT has quickly become a noteworthy entity within the MultiversX blockchain. Boasting a dedicated website [https://goshit.xyz](https://goshit.xyz/), social media presence, and a burgeoning community, $HIT is making waves. With a total supply of 420,696,969 $HIT coins and strategic listings on platforms such as Onedex and E-Compass, this token is not just about humor; it's about creating real value and utility within the MultiversX ecosystem.

Unlike traditional projects, $HIT prides itself on its community-driven approach, eschewing the need for a formal team structure and instead relying on a rapidly growing base of supporters and enthusiasts. Collaborations with renowned artists and plans for engaging the community in unique ways, such as logo competitions, are just the beginning. The true essence of $HIT lies in its innovative DeRug Protocol, aimed at rewarding those who help clean the ecosystem by identifying and disposing of rug-pulled NFTs.
